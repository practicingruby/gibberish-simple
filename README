= Gibberish::Simple

Gibberish::Simple is a Ruby 1.9 based standalone version of defunkt's Gibberish
rails plugin which has no external dependencies. Localized strings are filtered 
through a Gibberish::Simple#T() instead of String#[], which means that 
Gibberish::Simple does not modify core Ruby. Otherwise, the library is mostly 
API compatible with Gibberish, and Chris definitely deserves  credit for
all the hard parts.

Because Gibberish::Simple is not a Rails plugin, you need to manually tell it
where to find your translations by appending the path of your application.
